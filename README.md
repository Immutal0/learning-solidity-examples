# learning-solidity-2018

These examples are part of my guide [The best way to become Ethereum Developer in 2018](https://medium.com/@pbrudny/the-best-way-to-become-ethereum-solidity-developer-in-2018-5606e54646e6)


In Ethereum world everything is changing dynamically.
I decided to make a set of Smart Contracts for learning purposes.

I know it's funny to name a repo this way but I am quite convinced that in 2019 these examples may not work with the latest Solidity.

Try to write a contract yourself before checking the code in the repo!

## Examples

### 01_say_hello.sol
* set greeting on creation and allow to change it by the owner (creator of the contract)
* return greeting to everyone who calls `sayHello` method
* return `Hello Daddy` to the creator

### 02_balance_address_checker.sol
* return address of the contract
* return address of the contract's owner
* return address of the sender
* return balance of the contract
* return balance of the contract's owner (ONLY if you are the owner)
* return balance of the sender
