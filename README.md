# learning-solidity-2018
Basic examples of Solidity smart contracts.

In Ethereum world everything is changing dynamically so I decided to make a set of 
Smart Contracts for learning purposes using the latest syntax so that you can use them in 2018.

I know it's funny to name a repo this way but I am quite convinced that in 2019 these examples may not work with the latest Solidity.

These examples are part of my guide [The best way to become Ethereum Developer in 2018](https://medium.com/@pbrudny/the-best-way-to-become-ethereum-solidity-developer-in-2018-5606e54646e6)
