# learning-solidity-2018
Basic examples of Solidity Smart Contracts.

In Ethereum world everything is changing dynamically.
I decided to make a set of Smart Contracts for learning purposes 
using the latest syntax so that you can use them in 2018.

I know it's funny to name a repo this way but I am quite convinced that in 2019 these examples may not work with the latest Solidity.

These examples are part of my guide [The best way to become Ethereum Developer in 2018](https://medium.com/@pbrudny/the-best-way-to-become-ethereum-solidity-developer-in-2018-5606e54646e6)



# List of challenges

* set greeting on creation and allow to change it by the owner (creator of the contract)
* display greeting to everyone who calls `sayHello` method
* display `Hello Daddy` to the creator

Solution: `01_say_hello.sol`
